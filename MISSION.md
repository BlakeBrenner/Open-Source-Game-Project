# Mission Statement

The goal of this project is to design and implement a procedurally generated vertical platformer that emphasizes fair but challenging gameplay.

The game focuses on:
- Procedural level generation that always remains physically reachable
- Gradually increasing difficulty that rewards player upgrades
- Clean, modular game architecture
- A complete gameplay loop including scoring, upgrades, hazards, and game over states

This project was built to explore procedural generation, player-centric design, and game systems engineering using Godot.
